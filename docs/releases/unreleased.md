# Unreleased

The latest release is [C-Two 0.10.1](0.10.1.md) with the existing c3 0.6.0; its source, publication and cleanup evidence are in the [acceptance record](../reports/2026-10-30-0101-release-acceptance.md).

## Smaller public surface (breaking)

The Python and Rust SDKs now keep only the everyday API at their roots. Everything else moves into four modules, grouped by who uses it. The reasons and measurements are in the [interface review](../plans/2026-10-31-api-surface-review.md). Update imports; no aliases or old paths remain. Protocol, ABI, SHM and storage formats are unchanged.

### Python

The `c_two` root keeps:

- `crm`, `read`, `write`, `transfer`, `on_shutdown`
- `hold`, `HeldResult`
- `register`, `connect`, `close`, `unregister`, `serve`, `shutdown`, `server_address`, `with_call_options`
- `set_relay_anchor`, `set_server`, `set_client`, `set_transport_policy`, `set_call_execution_limits`
- `Runtime`, `ConcurrencyConfig`, `error`

Everything else moved:

| Module | Contents | Renamed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `c_two.owner` | owner control, recovery tickets, takeover, owned children, `LifecycleConfig` | `NativeOwnerBootstrap` → `OwnerBootstrap`; use `OwnerBootstrap.adopt_owner_stdin()` instead of `cc.adopt_owner_stdin()` |
| `c_two.endpoint` | endpoint contexts and credentials, `inspect_endpoint`, `reap_endpoint`, `sweep_endpoints`, `set_local_endpoint`, `server_credential`, `server_id` | — |
| `c_two.observe` | connection events, `memory_stats` and its types, `call_execution_snapshot` | `native_lifecycle_snapshot` → `lifecycle_snapshot`, `native_terminal_outcome` → `shutdown_outcome` |
| `c_two.contract` | descriptor export, release reference, diagnostics and code generation | `export_contract_descriptor` → `export_descriptor`, `export_contract_release_ref` → `release_ref`, `contract_descriptor_diagnostics` → `diagnostics`, `compile_contract_artifacts` → `compile_artifacts`, `ContractArtifact` → `Artifact`, `ContractArtifactSet` → `ArtifactSet`, `ContractCodegenError` → `CodegenError`, `ContractCodegenTarget` → `CodegenTarget` |

Module functions act on the default Runtime. `Runtime` methods of the same name act on an explicit instance.

### Removed

| Removed | Use instead |
| --- | --- |
| `cc.Held` | `cc.HeldResult` |
| `cc.hold_stats()` | `c_two.observe.memory_stats()["holds"]`; the `budget_cells_note` text field is also gone from the result |
| `ConcurrencyMode` and `InputLifetime` | the strings `'parallel'`, `'exclusive'`, `'read_parallel'` and `'materialized'`, `'borrowed'` |
| defaults for `@cc.crm(namespace=..., version=...)` | write both explicitly |
| `infer_crm_from_resource` and `c3 contract infer` | write a CRM class, then export it with `c3 contract export` |
| the resource bridge: `cc.bridge`, `cc.ResourceBridge`, `register(bridge=...)` | register a small adapter class that converts between `Payload` and domain values; every call path invokes it the same way |

`shutdown`, `call_execution_snapshot`, `lifecycle_snapshot`, `shutdown_outcome`, `inspect_endpoint` and `reap_endpoint` now return typed dictionaries. `c_two.error` declares `__all__`.

### Rust

The `c_two` crate root keeps runtime, hosting, connection, configuration-source, concurrency and error types. Endpoint administration, owner control, diagnostics and contract types move to `c_two::endpoint`, `c_two::owner`, `c_two::observe` and `c_two::contract`.

`direct_ipc_endpoint`, `ping_direct_ipc` and `shutdown_direct_ipc` take an `Option<&LocalEndpointContext>` and replace the `*_with_context` functions; `None` resolves the process configuration as before. Generated Rust modules use the new paths, so regenerate them.

### Validation

Local macOS validation passed on the integrated candidate, with C-Two and FastDB 0.2.4 checked out side by side. Linux and Windows GitHub Actions have not run yet.
