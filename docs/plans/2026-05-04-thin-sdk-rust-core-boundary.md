# Thin SDK / Rust Core Boundary Reference

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Status:** Architecture reference / implementation backlog
**Scope:** Identify Python SDK runtime state and mechanisms that should move
down into the Rust core so future language SDKs can stay thin.

## 0.x Constraint: Prefer Clean Cuts Over Compatibility Debt

C-Two is currently in the 0.x line. Implementation work from this document
should not preserve backwards compatibility for incorrect, experimental, or
superseded internal APIs unless a compatibility window is explicitly requested.
Do not leave dangling fallback behavior, compatibility shims, or zombie modules
after moving behavior into Rust. Remove obsolete code paths, tests, docs, and
module exports in the same change that replaces them.

## Non-Negotiable Runtime Constraint: IPC Must Not Depend On Relay

Direct single-node cross-process IPC must remain a complete standalone mode.
Relay is a discovery/forwarding layer, not the lead authority for IPC.

Required invariants:

- `cc.connect(..., address="ipc://...")` must bypass relay and connect through
  `c2-ipc` directly.
- `cc.register(...)` without `C2_RELAY_ANCHOR_ADDRESS` must still start a local IPC
  server and expose `cc.server_address()`.
- A bad or unavailable relay must not break explicit direct IPC connections.
- Rust-side runtime work must build a standalone IPC session first; relay
  registration/name resolution is only an optional projection above that
  session.
- Relay-backed name resolution uses `C2_RELAY_ANCHOR_ADDRESS` as the SDK
  process's control-plane relay anchor. Remote HTTP data-plane calls must go
  directly to the selected route's `relay_url`, and direct IPC selection from
  relay resolution is allowed only for loopback/local anchors.
- Thread-local same-process dispatch is an SDK/language optimization, not a
  replacement for cross-process IPC.

## Current Boundary Summary

C-Two already has the main language-neutral layers in Rust:

- `core/foundation/c2-config`: environment/default/config resolution.
- `core/foundation/c2-error`: canonical error code registry and wire bytes.
- `core/foundation/c2-mem`: SHM pool, buddy/dedicated/file-spill handles.
- `core/protocol/c2-wire`: wire frame, handshake, control, signal, chunk codec.
- `core/transport/c2-ipc`: direct IPC client, client pool, SHM/chunk transfer.
- `core/transport/c2-server`: direct IPC UDS server, dispatcher, scheduler.
- `core/transport/c2-http`: relay HTTP client, relay-aware route fallback,
  relay server behind the `relay` feature.
- `core/runtime/c2-runtime`: process runtime session, route transactions,
  client pools, relay projection, and lifecycle outcomes.

The Python SDK is already thinner than earlier versions, but it still owns
several generic runtime mechanisms that future SDKs would otherwise have to
reimplement. Those mechanisms should move to Rust without moving Python domain
logic, CRM decorators, or transferable serialization semantics.

## Keep In Python SDKs

These are language-specific and should not be forced into the Rust core:

- CRM decorators/metaclasses and Python method discovery:
  `sdk/python/src/c_two/crm/`.
- Python resource object invocation and Python exception presentation.
- Transferable dataclass conversion, `serialize`, `deserialize`, and
  `from_buffer` orchestration.
- Python proxy object construction and attaching `crm.client`.
- Thread-local same-process fast path that passes Python objects directly and
  skips serialization.
- SDK UX such as `cc.serve()` banner/signals, provided it does not own core
  transport semantics.

## Downshift Candidates

### Downshift Issue Status Ledger

This ledger tracks downshift issues in this document against the current
`dev-feature` branch. Do not mark an issue as implemented here unless the
corresponding Python-owned authority has actually been removed or reduced in
code, not merely planned in a separate implementation document.

| Issue | Candidate | Current status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Remote IPC scheduler config and execution semantics | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-04-remote-ipc-scheduler-rust-config.md`; this section below records Rust `c2-server` ownership and verified IPC/thread-local coverage. |
| 2 | Direct IPC probe/control helpers | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-04-direct-ipc-control-helpers-rust.md`; `c2-ipc` owns socket-path derivation plus ping/shutdown control helpers, and Python `client/util.py` is a thin native facade. |
| 3 | Process runtime/session state | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-05-runtime-session-rust-authority.md`; `core/runtime/c2-runtime` owns identity, route transactions, client pools, relay-anchor projection/name resolution, and shutdown/unregister outcomes. |
| 4 | Canonical error registry and wire bytes | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-06-canonical-error-rust-authority.md`; Rust `c2-error` owns registry/wire bytes and Python delegates through native codec bindings. |
| 5 | SDK-visible buffer lease lifecycle | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-06-unified-buffer-lease-rust-authority.md`; `c2-mem` owns retained buffer lease accounting and Python exposes only hold/result facades. |
| 6 | Server route slot lifecycle and readiness | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-07-server-readiness-rust-authority.md`; `c2-server` owns readiness, lifecycle transitions, socket unlink authority, and shutdown barriers. |
| 7 | Response allocation decision | Implemented | See `docs/plans/2026-05-07-response-allocation-rust-authority.md`; Python response-pool allocation was removed and low-copy response buffer preparation now lives in Rust native/core. |
| 8 | IPC config validation duplication | Planned | See `docs/plans/2026-05-07-ipc-config-validation-rust-authority.md`; next work removes Python allowed/forbidden-key checks and makes Rust/native config parsing the single validation authority. |
| 9 | Native method table facade | Backlog / low priority | Method discovery remains language-specific enough that this should only proceed if it removes real duplicated wire authority. |

### P1. Remote IPC scheduler config and execution semantics

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-04-remote-ipc-scheduler-rust-config.md`.

Route concurrency is owned by Rust `c2-server`. Python passes the full typed
`ConcurrencyConfig` during route registration; PyO3 parses `mode`,
`max_pending`, and `max_workers` into the native route handle; Rust acquires
the per-route guard around callback invocation and exposes a read-only
snapshot to the SDK. Python keeps `ConcurrencyConfig` as the typed facade and
keeps `Scheduler.execution_guard()` only as a thin adapter for thread-local
direct calls.

Verified coverage from that implementation includes remote IPC `exclusive`,
`parallel`, and `read_parallel` behavior; large SHM-backed hold input arriving
as `memoryview` over `ShmBuffer`; explicit direct `ipc://` bypassing a bad
relay environment; and thread-local calls continuing to pass Python objects
directly. Route-level `max_pending` and `max_workers` are now enforced by the
same Rust handle for remote IPC and same-process thread-local calls.

**Why this is core behavior**

Read/write/exclusive/parallel dispatch semantics are not Python-specific. Every
language SDK needs identical behavior once calls cross IPC. If this remains in
Python, future SDKs must reimplement scheduler semantics and risk diverging.

**Zero-copy constraint from design review**

Do not reintroduce an extra Python/Rust bytes copy while moving scheduler
configuration into Rust.

Safe migration boundary:

```text
Python ConcurrencyConfig
  -> pass mode / max_pending / worker-limit intent as typed config
RustServer.register_route(...)
  -> construct Rust Scheduler(mode, access_map, limits)
Rust Scheduler
  -> acquire locks/permits and call callback.invoke(...)
callback.invoke(...)
  -> keep RequestData::Shm / RequestData::Handle / RequestData::Inline
PyO3
  -> keep PyShmBuffer and memoryview(request_buf)
```

Unsafe migration boundary:

```text
Rust scheduler
  -> materialize SHM/handle payload as Python bytes before dispatch
  -> call Python with bytes instead of ShmBuffer/memoryview
```

That unsafe boundary would add the copy that was previously rejected. The P1
work is only to move scheduler *configuration and concurrency enforcement* into
Rust; it must not change the `RequestData -> PyShmBuffer -> memoryview` data
path.

**Thread-local caveat**

Thread-local dispatch is different from remote IPC. It passes Python objects
directly and intentionally skips serialization. Do not route thread-local calls
through Rust bytes dispatch for symmetry. The implemented shape projects a
small native route-concurrency handle into Python so same-process calls share
mode and capacity state with remote calls without serializing Python objects.
Each future SDK can use its own same-process fast path, but the shared
concurrency state must remain Rust-owned.

**Implementation notes**

1. Native `RustServer.register_route(...)` accepts a concurrency mode string
   from Python.
2. PyO3 parses Python mode strings into
   `c2_server::scheduler::ConcurrencyMode`.
3. `access_map` remains method-index-to-read/write metadata.
4. Rust applies the mode when constructing the per-route scheduler.
5. Python scheduler state is not an authority; it only forwards to the native
   handle for thread-local direct calls and snapshot/debug projection.
6. `max_pending` / `max_workers` are enforced by Rust for both local and
   remote execution paths.

**Required tests**

- Remote IPC `ConcurrencyMode::Exclusive` serializes all calls.
- Remote IPC `ConcurrencyMode::Parallel` permits concurrent writes.
- Remote IPC `ConcurrencyMode::ReadParallel` permits concurrent reads and
  serializes writes.
- Large SHM-backed requests still arrive in Python as `ShmBuffer`/
  `memoryview`, not `bytes`.
- Thread-local calls still skip serialization and still pass Python objects.
- Mixed thread-local/direct-IPC calls share `max_workers` and `max_pending`
  capacity limits through the same native route handle.

### P1. Direct IPC probe/control helpers

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-04-direct-ipc-control-helpers-rust.md`.

Rust `core/transport/c2-ipc` now owns socket-path derivation and direct IPC
control helpers for `ping()` and `shutdown()`. The PyO3 native layer exposes
`ipc_socket_path()`, `ipc_ping()`, and `ipc_shutdown()`. Python
`sdk/python/src/c_two/transport/client/util.py` delegates to those functions
and no longer owns raw UDS socket probing, copied frame structs, signal
constants, or socket-path derivation.

Malformed IPC addresses are rejected by Rust validation. Missing sockets return
the same boolean probe behavior through the native helper without making relay
part of the direct IPC control path.

`shutdown("ipc://...")` is an admin/control-plane helper, not a normal CRM
business-client method and not top-level `cc.shutdown()`. It intentionally
allows a same-host high-privilege supervisor process to stop a child resource
server by direct IPC address. Future name-based or cross-node shutdown should
extend this as an explicit authenticated admin control plane, with separate
route-level and server-level semantics, rather than hiding it behind ordinary
CRM calls.

**Why this is core behavior**

Signal frames, UDS path derivation, and IPC liveness probes are wire/IPC
control-plane behavior. They are language-neutral and already partially defined
in Rust through `c2-wire` constants and `c2-server` signal handling.

**IPC/no-relay impact**

This strengthens direct IPC independence. These helpers must live under
`c2-ipc`/native bindings, not `c2-http` or relay code.

**Verified coverage**

- `ping("ipc://...")` returns true against a direct IPC server with no relay.
- `shutdown("ipc://...")` stops a direct IPC server with no relay.
- Invalid IPC addresses are rejected through Rust validation.
- Owner-side bridge cleanup remains idempotent after an external direct IPC
  shutdown signal; native runtime draining must not depend on lifecycle
  readiness still being `running`.

### P1. Process runtime/session state

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-05-runtime-session-rust-authority.md`.

Rust `core/runtime/c2-runtime` now owns process-level runtime/session state.
The Python registry is a facade around native `RuntimeSession` plus
language-specific CRM binding and proxy construction.

Rust-owned pieces include:

- local server identity and canonical `ipc://` address;
- server/client IPC override storage and resolved client config projection;
- client config freeze after first connection acquisition;
- direct IPC client acquire/release/refcount/shutdown through the native
  session pool;
- explicit HTTP client acquire/release/refcount/shutdown through the native
  session projection;
- lazy server bridge creation through `ensure_server_bridge()`;
- route registration transactions through `register_route()`;
- local unregister and shutdown transaction outcomes;
- relay address projection, relay-backed name resolution, and relay cleanup
  error reporting.

Python still owns Python CRM local bindings, thread-local proxy construction,
and invoking `@on_shutdown` callbacks from native structured outcomes.

**Why this is core behavior**

Most of this is not Python-specific. A future SDK should not have to reproduce
server identity generation, standalone IPC session lifecycle, client pool
configuration, and registration transaction rules.

**Correct target shape**

```text
Rust RuntimeSession
  - standalone local IPC server identity/address
  - direct IPC server lifecycle
  - direct IPC client pool and default config
  - route registration handles
  - local unregister/shutdown transaction rules
  - optional RelayProjection for relay register/unregister/resolve
```

Relay projection must not own the base session. The base IPC session exists and
works when relay is absent.

**Verified coverage**

- No relay: `register -> server_address -> connect(address)` works across
  processes.
- Bad relay env: explicit direct IPC address still works.
- Relay register failure does not leave split-brain local/Rust route state.
- Explicit unregister preserves local correctness even if relay cleanup fails.
- Name-only relay connections go through native `RuntimeSession.connect_via_relay()`.
- Relay anchor config uses the clean-cut `C2_RELAY_ANCHOR_ADDRESS` /
  `cc.set_relay_anchor(...)` surface. The retired `C2_RELAY_ADDRESS` /
  `cc.set_relay(...)` names are not read as aliases.
- Name-only relay connections may select direct IPC only when the configured
  relay anchor is loopback/local. Nonlocal anchor responses are forced through
  HTTP routing even if an `ipc_address` is present.
- Remote HTTP data-plane calls use the resolved route's `relay_url` directly,
  avoiding a client -> anchor relay -> remote relay forwarding hop.
- Relay `/_resolve` strips `ipc_address` for non-loopback HTTP callers as
  defense-in-depth; peer routes already omit IPC addresses.
- Shutdown drains native IPC/HTTP clients and consumes native relay cleanup
  outcomes before clearing Python local bindings.

### P1. Canonical error registry and wire bytes

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-06-canonical-error-rust-authority.md`.

Rust `core/foundation/c2-error` owns the canonical error code registry and the
canonical `code:message` error wire bytes. The format is named `wire`, not
`legacy`, because it is still the active C-Two error payload format. Python
keeps only SDK presentation: `ERROR_Code` as a public enum facade generated
from `_native.error_registry()`, Python exception subclasses, and subclass
mapping for `CCError.deserialize()`.

**Copy constraints**

- Python `CCError.deserialize(...)` passes the input buffer directly to native
  decode and does not call `memoryview.tobytes()` or `bytes(data)` first.
- Native decode returns only `(code, message)` for the SDK hot path. It does
  not allocate a dict or return the error name for normal Python exception
  construction.
- Native encode writes `code:message` directly into the Python bytes allocation
  and avoids an intermediate Rust `Vec<u8>` where practical.
- Python malformed-payload presentation remains SDK-owned: native parser errors
  become `CCError(ERROR_UNKNOWN, "Malformed error payload: ...")` instead of
  leaking native `ValueError` through user-facing call paths.

**Verified coverage**

- All Python `ERROR_Code` values match the Rust registry.
- `CCError.serialize()` uses native `encode_error_wire()`.
- `CCError.deserialize()` uses native `decode_error_wire_parts()` without a
  Python pre-copy.
- Unknown numeric codes map to `ERROR_UNKNOWN` with canonical Rust context.
- Malformed wire payloads keep Python public behavior.
- Boundary tests prevent Python from reimplementing the `code:message` parser.
- Transfer hook errors distinguish bytes deserialization from buffer-backed
  `from_buffer()` construction on both resource input and client output. Rust
  `c2-error` owns `ResourceInputFromBuffer = 4` and
  `ClientOutputFromBuffer = 8`; SDKs project those codes and choose the
  precise hook-specific presentation error without re-owning the wire codec.
- `c2-server` emits canonical `c2-error` wire bytes for route-capacity,
  route-closed, and server-side internal execution errors instead of raw
  UTF-8 status strings, so issue1/3 route outcomes remain compatible with
  the issue4 decoder.

### P2. SDK-visible buffer lease lifecycle

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-06-unified-buffer-lease-rust-authority.md`.
Post-review repair also landed for deserialize-only client output hold: any
successful `cc.hold()` response that keeps a native response owner alive is
counted as a retained client-response lease until `HeldResult.release()`, even
when the output type falls back to `deserialize()` rather than `from_buffer()`.

Rust `core/foundation/c2-mem` owns SDK-visible buffer lease accounting for
runtime-owned buffers exposed to language SDKs. Inline, SHM, handle, and
file-spill buffers are storage tiers; transient view mode and retained hold
mode are retention policies. Python keeps `cc.hold()`, `HeldResult`,
`from_buffer()` orchestration, and warning presentation, but retained entry
state, byte totals, ages, storage/direction aggregation, and stale snapshots
come from native accounting.

Client-side `cc.hold()` is the primary retained lease path. Resource-side
`@cc.transfer(..., buffer="hold")` input retention uses the same native tracker
as a diagnostic path. Inline retained buffers are counted because they can back
zero-copy `memoryview` outputs through native-owned `Vec<u8>`; they are reported
separately from SHM-backed retained buffers so memory pressure diagnostics stay
accurate.

**Verified coverage**

- Inline client-response `cc.hold()` counts as a retained lease and releases on
  `HeldResult.release()` / context manager / GC fallback.
- SHM or handle client-response `cc.hold()` uses the same API and releases
  through the existing `ResponseBuffer.release()` memory path.
- Resource-side input hold uses the same native retained tracker without
  Python weakref accounting.
- `hold_stats()` works without a Python server object and reports storage and
  direction breakdowns.
- Direct IPC retained buffers remain relay-independent.
- Client output `from_buffer()` and resource input `from_buffer()` failure
  paths release their memoryview/native buffer owner before propagating a
  `CCError`, so traceback-local response/request objects do not pin stale
  retained lease stats.
- Deserialize-only outputs wrapped with `cc.hold()` are counted as retained
  client-response leases because `HeldResult` still keeps the native response
  owner and memoryview alive until explicit release.
- Default view mode still releases immediately and does not materialize payloads
  or add retained accounting overhead.

**Non-blocking future hardening notes**

The current implementation covers the issue5 ownership boundary. Further work
should be treated as hardening rather than a second architecture: keep `c2-mem`
as the source of truth, keep `ResponseBuffer.release()` / `ShmBuffer.release()`
as memory-release authority, and improve only the SDK/native seam. A future
hardening plan can focus on (1) locking down successful-hold tracking semantics
for both `from_buffer()` and deserialize-only outputs, (2) making native retained
tracking calls idempotent and non-leaking under exceptional paths, and (3)
extracting cross-SDK conformance tests that Go, Rust, Fortran, and Python can
share without forcing payload copies or SHM promotion for inline results.

### P2. Server route slot lifecycle and readiness

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-07-server-readiness-rust-authority.md`.

Rust `c2-server` owns IPC server lifecycle state and readiness notification.
Native startup exposes `start_and_wait(timeout)` and state projection through
`is_running` / `is_ready`. Python `NativeServerBridge` keeps CRM slot objects
and Python callback dispatch, but it no longer polls socket files, maintains a
separate `_started` flag, or infers readiness from filesystem state.

Rust also tracks whether a concrete `Server` instance actually bound its socket
path before it is allowed to unlink that path during shutdown. This prevents a
failed second server startup from removing the active socket owned by an
already-running server.

Each native start attempt is explicitly fenced by Rust before PyO3 begins
waiting for readiness. The fence resets stale terminal lifecycle state
(`Stopped` / `Failed`) and the one-shot shutdown signal so normal restart after
shutdown, and retry after a failed bind once the socket is released, cannot be
poisoned by a previous attempt.

Native shutdown is also a lifecycle barrier. PyO3 waits for native stop
notification before dropping the runtime and terminalizes runtime-owned
`Starting` / `Ready` / `Stopping` states after forced runtime cleanup while
preserving `Failed(_)` diagnostics. This prevents immediate restart from seeing
transient `Stopping` after `RustServer.shutdown()` returns.

**Verified coverage**

- `Server.start(timeout=...)` returns only after direct IPC ping/connect can
  succeed.
- Starting a second server on an active IPC socket fails without unlinking the
  first server's socket path.
- Calling shutdown on a server that failed to bind does not unlink another
  server's active socket path.
- The same native server bridge can start again after normal shutdown.
- Repeated tight start/shutdown cycles do not expose stale `Stopping` through
  `is_started()` or poison the next start.
- A duplicate server whose first start failed can retry successfully after the
  active socket owner shuts down.
- Runtime shutdown outcomes use native lifecycle state instead of
  `socket_path().exists()`.
- Direct IPC readiness remains relay-independent, including with a bad relay
  environment variable.
- Boundary tests prevent Python socket polling and Python-owned `_started`
  lifecycle state from being reintroduced.

### P2. Response allocation decision

**Implemented ownership**

Status: implemented on `dev-feature` by
`docs/plans/2026-05-07-response-allocation-rust-authority.md`.

Python dispatcher now returns only `None` or serialized bytes-like data after
CRM method execution. It no longer receives a native response pool object,
compares `len(res_part)` against `shm_threshold`, writes response SHM, returns
SHM coordinate tuples, or converts `memoryview` outputs with `bytes(...)` for
transport.

Rust `c2-server::response::try_prepare_shm_response()` owns threshold-based
large response SHM preparation and post-allocation cleanup. Payloads that are
valid for the configured response path but too large for buddy SHM wire
metadata fall back to owned bytes so the Rust server can choose chunked
transport rather than reporting a CRM failure. PyO3
`parse_response_meta()` accepts `bytes` and generic `PyBuffer<u8>` exporters,
attempts direct Python-buffer-to-response-SHM writes for large outputs, and
only materializes owned inline bytes for small outputs or SHM allocation
fallback. It rejects outputs above `ServerIpcConfig.max_payload_size` before
allocating fallback buffers. Existing `send_response_meta()` remains the final
inline / buddy SHM / chunked transport selector for owned bytes, with core-side
`max_payload_size` enforcement plus checked inline frame length, buddy
data-size, and chunk-count limits.

**Verified coverage**

- Rust helper tests cover below-threshold no-allocation behavior, large
  direct SHM writes, allocation-failure fallback, and cleanup after copy
  failure.
- Rust reply-selection tests cover oversized buddy wire fallback, inline frame
  length limits, chunk-count overflow rejection, and response allocation
  cleanup when reply writes fail.
- Direct IPC integration tests cover large `bytes` responses, large
  `memoryview` responses, small inline responses through `cc.hold()` retained
  storage accounting, and `max_payload_size` rejection as a resource output
  serialization error.
- Boundary tests prevent Python response-pool allocation and PyO3 SHM
  coordinate tuple parsing from being reintroduced.
- Direct IPC response allocation remains relay-independent, including with a
  bad relay environment variable.

### P2. IPC config validation duplication

**Planned ownership**

Status: implementation plan drafted in
`docs/plans/2026-05-07-ipc-config-validation-rust-authority.md`.

Python `sdk/python/src/c_two/config/ipc.py` still keeps allowed-key and
forbidden-key checks that duplicate native resolver checks in
`sdk/python/native/src/config_ffi.rs`. The planned repair keeps Python
`TypedDict` schemas as SDK type hints, removes Python `_normalize_*` and
`_clean_ipc_overrides` validation helpers, passes override mappings directly
into native config parsing, and makes Rust/native validation produce the
canonical user-facing errors.

The implementation plan also moves the IPC override key catalog into
`core/foundation/c2-config` so PyO3 bindings consume Rust-core field lists
instead of maintaining SDK-side allowed-key tables. PyO3 snapshots arbitrary
Python mappings before parsing, preserving copy/freeze semantics without
letting Python own validation state.

**Required coverage**

- Unknown server/client IPC override errors still point to the offending key
  and come from native validation.
- `shm_threshold` remains a global transport policy override, not an IPC role
  override.
- Mapping subclasses are accepted and snapshotted by native parsing.
- Non-mapping override inputs and non-string override keys fail with precise
  native `TypeError` messages.
- Boundary tests prevent Python allowed-key, forbidden-key, and `_normalize_*`
  validation helpers from being reintroduced.

### P3. Native method table facade

**Current Python ownership**

`sdk/python/src/c_two/transport/wire.py` retains a Python `MethodTable` for
server dispatch mapping.

**Why low priority**

Method discovery is language-specific, and the Python table is small. Rust
already owns client handshake method tables. Moving this is mostly cleanup, not
a major cross-language risk.

**Implementation sketch**

Expose a native method table type only if it simplifies route registration or
removes duplicated wire limits. Do not prioritize this ahead of scheduler,
runtime/session, IPC control helpers, and error/config canonicalization.

## Suggested Execution Order

1. Remote IPC scheduler config, with explicit zero-copy guardrails.
2. Direct IPC probe/control helpers in `c2-ipc`.
3. Native runtime/session design for standalone IPC plus optional relay
   projection.
4. Canonical Python error facade over `c2-error`.
5. Hold lease tracking and server readiness cleanup.
6. Response allocation decision without payload-copy regression.
7. Config validation deduplication.
8. Native method table cleanup only if still useful.

## Regression Matrix For Future Work

Every implementation spawned from this reference should preserve:

- No relay direct IPC cross-process success.
- Bad relay does not affect explicit `ipc://` connection.
- Name-only connect without relay fails clearly when the resource is not local.
- Relay-aware name resolution uses Rust relay-aware HTTP client when configured.
- Relay anchor resolution cannot trick a client configured with a nonlocal
  anchor into dialing arbitrary local IPC.
- Remote relay HTTP calls use the resolved route's `relay_url` directly rather
  than adding an anchor-relay forwarding hop.
- Thread-local same-process calls do not serialize Python objects.
- SHM-backed remote IPC requests arrive as `ShmBuffer`/`memoryview`.
- Large result replies keep using Rust transport selection and avoid avoidable
  copies.

## Notes For Future SDK Authors

The intended SDK shape is:

```text
Language SDK
  - language contract/decorator/interface model
  - language object invocation
  - language serialization hooks
  - thin typed config facade
  - thin proxy facade

Rust core/native
  - config/default/env resolution
  - direct IPC server/client/session lifecycle
  - wire protocol
  - SHM/chunk/file-spill memory mechanisms
  - remote IPC scheduling
  - relay-aware route fallback
  - canonical error registry/encoding
```

Do not move language-specific transferable behavior into Rust merely for
symmetry. Do move any behavior that a second SDK would otherwise have to copy
verbatim.
